                    <p> The Taj Mahal is an Islamic ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna
                        in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1631 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (r.
                        1628–1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of
                        Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which
                        includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a
                        crenellated wall.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other
                        phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been
                        completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million,
                        which in 2020 would be approximately ₹70 billion (about US $1 billion). The construction project
                        employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court
                        architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri. Various types of symbolism have been employed in
                        the Taj to reflect natural beauty and divinity.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of
                        Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It
                        is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich
                        history. The Taj Mahal attracts more than 6 million visitors a year[3] and in 2007, it was
                        declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.</p><br>

                    <p> The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical
                        northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various
                        nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th
                        century BC, with selective stretches later joined together by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the
                        first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains.Later on, many successive dynasties built
                        and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were
                        built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the
                        imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of
                        trade and the control of immigration and emigration. Furthermore, the defensive characteristics
                        of the Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison
                        stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and the fact that the path
                        of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The frontier walls built by different dynasties have multiple courses. Collectively, they stretch
                        from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, from the present-day Sino–Russian border in
                        the north to Tao River (Taohe) in the south; along an arc that roughly delineates the edge of
                        the Mongolian steppe; spanning 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi) in total. Today, the defensive system
                        of the Great Wall is generally recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in
                        history.[</p><br>

                    <p>Petra , originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu or Raqēmō,is a historic and archaeological
                        city in southern Jordan. It is adjacent to the mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah, in a basin
                        surrounded by mountains forming the eastern flank of the Arabah valley running from the Dead Sea
                        to the Gulf of Aqaba. The area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC, and the
                        Nabataeans might have settled in what would become the capital city of their kingdom as early as
                        the 4th century BC. Archaeological work has only discovered evidence of Nabataean presence
                        dating back to the second century BC, by which time Petra had become their capital. The
                        Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra's proximity to the incense trade routes by
                        establishing it as a major regional trading hub.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The trading business gained the Nabataeans considerable revenue and Petra became the focus of
                        their wealth. The Nabataeans were accustomed to living in the barren deserts, unlike their
                        enemies, and were able to repel attacks by taking advantage of the area's mountainous terrain.
                        They were particularly skillful in harvesting rainwater, agriculture and stone carving. Petra
                        flourished in the 1st century AD, when its famous Al-Khazneh structure believed to be the
                        mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas IV was constructed, and its population peaked at an estimated
                        20,000 inhabitants.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Although the Nabataean kingdom became a client state of the Roman Empire in the first century BC,
                        it was only in 106 AD that it lost its independence. Petra fell to the Romans, who annexed
                        Nabataea and renamed it as Arabia Petraea. Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes
                        emerged, and after an earthquake in 363 destroyed many structures. In the Byzantine era several
                        Christian churches were built, but the city continued to decline, and by the early Islamic era
                        it was abandoned except for a handful of nomads. It remained unknown until it was rediscovered
                        in 1812 by Johann Ludwig Burckhardt.</p><br>
                    <p>Access to the city is through a 1.2-kilometre-long gorge called the Siq, which leads directly to
                        the Khazneh. Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit system, Petra is also called
                        the "Rose City" because of the colour of the stone from which it is carved. It has been a UNESCO
                        World Heritage Site since 1985. UNESCO has described Petra as "one of the most precious cultural
                        properties of man's cultural heritage". In 2007, Al-Khazneh was voted one of the New 7 Wonders
                        of the World. Petra is a symbol of Jordan, as well as Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction.
                        Tourist numbers peaked at 1.1 million in 2019, marking the first time that the figure rose above
                        the 1 million mark. Tourism in the city was crippled by the COVID-19 pandemic, but soon after
                        started to pick up again, reaching 260,000 visitors in 2021.</p><br>

                    <p> Chichen Itza was a large pre-Columbian city built by the Maya people of the Terminal Classic
                        period. The archeological site is located in Tinúm Municipality, Yucatán State, Mexico.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Chichen Itza was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic (c. AD
                        600–900) through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) and into the early portion of the
                        Postclassic period (c. AD 900–1200). The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles,
                        reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern
                        Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles was once thought to have been
                        representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico, but most contemporary
                        interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural
                        diffusion.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Chichen Itza was one of the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been one of the
                        mythical great cities, or Tollans, referred to in later Mesoamerican literature. The city may
                        have had the most diverse population in the Maya world, a factor that could have contributed to
                        the variety of architectural styles at the site.</p><br>
                    <p>The ruins of Chichen Itza are federal property, and the site's stewardship is maintained by

                    <p>Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru on
                        a 2,430-meter (7,970 ft) mountain ridge.It is located in the Machupicchu District within
                        Urubamba Province above the Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometers (50 mi) northwest of Cusco.
                        The Urubamba River flows past it, cutting through the Cordillera and creating a canyon with a
                        tropical mountain climate.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The Incas, in contrast to the Maya, had no written language, and no European visited the site
                        until the 19th century, so far as is known. There are, therefore, no written records of the site
                        while it was in use. The names of the buildings, their supposed uses, and their inhabitants are
                        all the product of modern archeologists, on the basis of physical evidence, including tombs at
                        the site.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Most recent archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was constructed as an estate for the Inca
                        emperor Pachacuti (1438–1472). Often referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas", it is the most
                        familiar icon of Inca civilization. The Incas built the estate around 1450 but abandoned it a
                        century later, at the time of the Spanish conquest. According to the new AMS radiocarbon dating,
                        it was occupied from c. 1420–1532. Historical research published in 2022 claims that the site
                        was probably called Huayna Picchu by the Inca, as it exists on the smaller peak of the same
                        name.</p><br>
                    <p>Machu Picchu was built in the classical Inca style, with polished dry-stone walls. Its three
                        primary structures are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three
                        Windows. Most of the outlying buildings have been reconstructed in order to give visitors a
                        better idea of how they originally appeared.By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored and
                        restoration continues.</p><br>

                    <p> The Colosseum is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the
                        Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest
                        standing amphitheatre in the world today, despite its age. Construction began under the emperor
                        Vespasian in 72 and was completed in 80 AD under his successor and heir, Titus . Further
                        modifications were made during the reign of Domitian .The three emperors that were patrons of
                        the work are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian
                        Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian: Anfiteatro Flavio by later classicists and
                        archaeologists for its association with their family name (Flavius).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The Colosseum is built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete.
                        It could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points in its history, having
                        an average audience of some 65,000; it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles
                        including animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Roman
                        mythology, and briefly mock sea battles. The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the
                        early medieval era. It was later reused for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a
                        religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Although substantially ruined by earthquakes and stone robbers taking spolia, the Colosseum is
                        still an iconic symbol of Imperial Rome and was listed as one of the New 7 Wonders of the World.
                        It is one of Rome's most popular tourist attractions and also has links to the Roman Catholic
                        Church, as each Good Friday the Pope leads a torchlit "Way of the Cross" procession that starts
                        in the area around the Colosseum. The Colosseum is depicted on the Italian version of the
                        five-cent euro coin.</p><br>

                    <p> Christ the Redeemer (Portuguese: Cristo Redentor, standard Brazilian Portuguese, is an Art Deco
                        statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by French sculptor Paul Landowski and
                        built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with French engineer Albert
                        Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida fashioned the face. Constructed between 1922 and
                        1931, the statue is 30 metres (98 ft) high, excluding its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal. The arms
                        stretch 28 metres (92 ft) wide.It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone. The Christ the
                        Redeemer differs considerably from its original design. The initial plan was a large Christ with
                        a globe in one hand and a cross in the other. Although the project organisers originally
                        accepted the design, it later changed to the statue of today, with the arms spread out wide.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> The statue weighs 635 metric tons (625 long, 700 short tons), and is located at the peak of the
                        700-metre (2,300 ft) Corcovado mountain in the Tijuca National Park overlooking the city of Rio
                        de Janeiro. A symbol of Christianity around the world, the statue has also become a cultural
                        icon of both Rio de Janeiro and Brazil and was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.
